# Build An Arithmetic Formatter Project
## Description
In this project, we created a function called arithmetic_arranger to format arithmetic problems into a neatly arranged vertical structure, making them easier to readâ€”similar to how students typically align calculations in primary school. The function supports addition and subtraction while ensuring proper alignment, spacing, and error handling.
We first wrote the code to process each problem and output the resulting equations in neat lines, then added code to check for errors.

# Project: password generator using regular expressions

In tbis project, we learned about generating passwords and checking for constraints regular expressions. We learned to use the `re` regular expression module
and learned some basic regular expressions such as `[a-b]` and `a+` and special characters such as `\w` (for word characters including`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and `_`)
  and how to combine format and raw strings.
